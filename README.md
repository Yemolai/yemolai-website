# Yemolai's personal website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is intended to
showcase my React skills, so you can look around and check out what I can do with this framework.

This project will be deployed @ [yemolai.dev](https://yemolai.dev) and you can contact me through this email address:
[contact@yemolai.dev](mailto:contact@yemolai.dev).
